# JavaSpringTutorial

## [Class 4](https://github.com/fahimfarhan/JavaSpringTutorial/tree/class-4)
1. Go to start.spring.io, select language, version etc.
2. Add dependencies. The initial dependency is `Spring web`

The initial code is
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class StartApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(StartApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is very powerful, and important. It 
has 3 components:
* `@SpringBootConfiguration`:  creates `bean` in some `container`. Bean is like lazy initialization
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Auto-generates different objects. So we don't need to manually create certain objects.
* `@ComponentScan`: We're gonna use @Controller, @Service etc throughout the code. This annotation scans these all, and makes them available to the Spring framework 


## What is a `Bean`?
Suppose, 
```java
class Addition {
  int add(int i) { return 0; } // todo: logic
}
class Math {
  Addition addition = new Addition();  // <--- this object is created at the very beginning!
  
  void addNumber(int i) {
    addition.add(i); // todo: logic
  }
}
```

We don't want to create `addition` object at start time. So we use `bean`, which creates the `addition` object when we need it. 
How do we do that?

```java
@Component       // step 1: Add this line
class Addition {
  int add(int i) { return 0; } // todo: logic
}

```
This creates a bean, and stores it inside an IOC container.  Now in the class Math, you do this:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

@Component  // <-- step 3
class Math {

  @Autowired  // <-- step 4. This connects the variable with the corresponding bean
  Addition addition;

  void addNumber(int i) {
    addition.add(i); // todo: logic
  }
}
```

3. We want to follow clean architecture. 
    user <---------> controller <-------> Services <-------> Repository <----------> DB
    Our controller class will look like this:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;

@RestController   // <----------------- Annotates that this is a controller class. The user will first time reach here!
public class GreetController {

  @GetMapping("/greet")
    // <------------- connects an API endpoints to a method
  String greet() {
    return "Hello there!";
  }


  @RequestMapping(value = "/greet-v2", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    // <------------- connects an API endpoints to a method
  String greet() {
    return "Hello there!";
  }
}
```

4. Create a model class `Email.java`:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

class Email {
  private String title;
  private String description;
  private String someThingSecret;

  // constructor, getter, setter etc

  // if we want to ignore a field from returning to the client, use @JsonIgnore on the getter
  @JsonIgnore
  public String getSomeThingSecret() {
    return someThingSecret;
  }
}
```

5. Create an EmailService, and EmailController. Annotate them with `@Service`, and `@RestController` respectively.

6. Inside the EmailController, create an EmailService using `@AutoWired` annotation. The @Service creates an EmailService bean, that is 
   stored inside IOC (Inversion of Container). The `@AutoWired` annotation automatically links the variable with the reference of EmailService object stored in IOC.

```java
      class EmailController {
        //  @Autowired // warning dey ken? Vo.O
        //  private EmailService emailService;
      
        private EmailService emailService;
    
        @Autowired  // AutoWired using setter. Alternatively, use constructor as autocorrected by intellijIdea.
        public void setEmailService(EmailService emailService) {
          this.emailService = emailService;
        }
      }
```
7. `@PostMapping`

8. Custom exception handling: use `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)`

9. In post request, Add the annotation, `@RequestBody Model model`

10. In postman, by default `text` is selected. Change it to `json`, else you'll get error.

## [Class 5](https://github.com/fahimfarhan/JavaSpringTutorial/tree/class-5)
Previously in class 4, we saw RestController, Service, and Repository.
```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[user] --> B[emailController];
    B --> C[EmailService];
    C --> D[EmailService];
    D --> E[list of emails];
```

Today, we'll add a persistence layer (database).


```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[user] --> B[emailController];
    B --> C[EmailService];
    C --> D[EmailService];
    D -- email --> E[DataBase];
```
We'll use Spring JPA dependency. All we need to o is give JPA a model, in this case `Email`.
For simplicity, we'll use an inMemory database called `H2 database`. In the next class,
we'll see microservices, and there we'll use postgresql.

1. Add h2-db, jpa, and hibernate-core dependencies. Update: hibernamte-core is not needed. I had added a wrong JPA dependency, that's why I got error. Changing the JPA resolved the problem.

2. Create an interface called `EmailRepository`, and annotate with `@Repository`.

3. The emailRepo should extend `JpaRepository`.

4. ORM = Object relation mapping

5. Annotate the Email class with `@Entity`

6. Create a field `id` for primary key. The primary key must be annotated with `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`.

7. Update the emailService class by adding Autowired emailRepository object.

```
Question: How do I define this bean entityManagerFactory? Help needed.

8. Changing the JPA dependency repaired the error in step 7

9. Add Spring boot starter security dependency, change nothing else, and run. The get requests will give `401 unauthorized` error. In the logs, you'll find sth like this

```bash
Using generated security password: 5a31a789-2c8b-4f45-875a-b59821e3648f

This generated password is for development use only. Your security configuration must be updated before running your application in production.
```
Use that to get authorized. So in postman, select `basic auth`, then set `username = user`, and `password = 5a31a789-2c8b-4f45-875a-b59821e3648f`.
The get request should now work.

10. Open the `application.properties` file, and add

```properties
spring.security.user.name=ricardo_milos  # your user name,
spring.security.user.password=1234       # your password
```
(if we are going to save username, and password here, either this file must be in .gitignore, or use something like .env file, and read username, password from there.
I guess we're in early stage, and so we're keeping it simple.)
Now goto postman, and in our get request, change username, password to those that you set in your `application.properties`.

11. The get request will work, but the post request won't work!

12. **CSRF** = cross site request forgery

<img src="./docs/pics/class-5-img-1-csrf.png" alt="img3.jpg" width="500"/>

13. Spring security adds protection to `patch`, `put`, `post`, `delete` requests as they **modify the records in th db**, but NOT `get`, since we only read from db.

14. Create a class `SecurityConfig` so that we may change the default behavior of the spring config. Create `SecurityConfig.java`, and disable `csrf` for development convenience. Don't do it in production, since you'll
face malicious attacks (pg botnet attack?). 
```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[bot] -- bruteforce attack --> B[18.xxx.xxx.xxx:5432 postgre sql default port];
    B --> C[Scanning Phase, tries to log into db];
    C --> D[into postgresql, copy them];
    D --> E[Access file system];
    E --> F[do sth, eg, crypto mining];
```
How to prevent them? A. use strong password, B. use docker (the attacker won't get access into the main OS even if the docker is breached).

15. if post response is successful, return `ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).build()`, else return badRequest.

16. Open up `EmailRepository`, and add this interface method:

```java
@Repository
public interface EmailRepository extends JpaRepository<Email, Integer> {
  /**
   Jpa knows `findBy` keyword. so we have to give the last word.In our model, we have
   title. so it will become Title
   titlle => Titlle

   Format:
   first character upperCase + the rest of the string is exactly the same. That's it!
   */
  Email findByTitle(String title);
  Email findByTitleIgnoreCase(String title);
}
```
Jpa knows `findBy` keyword. so we have to give the last word.In our model, we have
```text
title. so it will become Title
titlle => Titlle

Format:
first character upperCase + the rest of the string is exactly the same. That's it!
```

## [Class 6](https://github.com/fahimfarhan/JavaSpringTutorial/tree/class-6)

Today we'll work with micro-services. In the previous class, we built only one service (EmailService). If we want to 
make, say, an ecommerce website, there will be a myriad kinds of services. Only a small service maybe an emailService.
The instructor worked on an emailService in his company that sends customers an auto-generated email every month.

When we build a monolithic application, there will be a lot of services. But a microservice has a lot of services. So
what's the difference :monocle_face: ?

Let's juxtapose the 2 to see their differences.

```text
   ---------------------------
   |    inventory            |  <--- Everything in one server. So only one ip for everything.
   |                         |       this is 127.0.0.1:8080, everything is seperated with /inventory, /store, /shipping...
   |    store                |       this  is the problem. Suppose it is black friday. There will be a lot of sale. 
   |                         |
   |    Shipping             |
   ---------------------------
     Monolithic architecture
```
Teletalk ssc, hsc exam service goes down. say no more...

On black friday, there will be a lot of hits on the `/shipping`. Since we want to scale up, the entire thing gets scaled.
So we have unused `/inventory`, and `/store` services running.

```text
   ---------------------------
   |        inventory        |  scale up. After rush hour, scale down...
   ---------------------------
   
   ------------
   |   store  |   scale down. During rush hour, scale up...
   ------------
   
   ---------------------------
   |    Shipping             |  scale up. After rush hour, scale down...
   ---------------------------

    Microservice architecture
```

What is the main advantage of using microservice architecture?

If one is down, the rest of the services won't be affected. If `inventory` is down, the `store` and `shipping` are 
working. In monolithic, everything is down if the server is down.

<img src="./docs/pics/class-6-pic-1-microservice-architecture.png" alt="class-6-pic-1-microservice-architecture.png" width="500"/>

The instructor is using maven cli to generate a new project. I'll be using gradle.

* Random question by a course-mate: Which language is better for microservice architecture? *

Answer: Language doesn't matter. Every language has some similarities. Such as OOP is similar in c++, java, c#. If you
know one, you can do it in any language.

Now for microservice, different frameworks exists in different language. Python-djando, java-spring, ...

The important question is, `What are we building?`

If we are building very complex / enterprise level software, most of the time we select java. Netflix, Amazon have a lot
of their services built with java.

But if you want to build sth in short notice, then perhaps nodejs is better.

Everything has its pros and cons. So language doesn't matter, but the project matters. What we are building, what is the
service, what the design should be , matters.

So, I created a project in gradle (because android..., and here I diverge from the video), and now I need to add some
dependencies.

In mvn, one needs to add a plugin management. Not sure if we need that in gradle.

## Dependencies
* Add spring boot
```kotlin
plugins {
  // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
  application
  java
  id("org.springframework.boot") version "2.7.5"
  id("io.spring.dependency-management") version "1.0.11.RELEASE"

}
```
* there will be 2 dependency blocks: parent, and child. Since we're building microservices, there will be a lot of 
  common dependencies. We'll add those in the parent block. And the child specific dependencies will go inside the child's
  block.
* Looks like I'm gonna need to google a few things for gradle. Alternatively, I'll just open android studio project, and
  copy the top level gradle. Here's a [github gist link(kotlin)](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl-samples/blob/master/samples/hello-android/build.gradle.kts)
  or [github gist link(gradle)](https://gist.github.com/SeanZoR/af0932faea7d74e3a98e) to help you get started.
* Since I'll be using spring-boot everywhere, it should go inside the top level gradle.

(Change of plan, stick to the video, and use maven. Later when I'll understand everything properly, I'll use gradle).

Create maven project `my-app`, using the command:
```bash
mvn -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
```
Then we'll be configuring our `pom.xml`. Initially,
```xml

<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.7</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>

<dependencies>
<!-- video te junit silo na, amartay ase...-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.11</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Add spring-boot dependencies in the `properties`.
```xml

<properties>
<!-- initial dependencies... -->
    <spring.boot.maven.plugin.version>2.7.1</spring.boot.maven.plugin.version>
    <spring.boot.dependencies.version>2.7.1</spring.boot.dependencies.version>
</properties>
```

We'll be building microservices. We'll have lots of services under `my-app`. My app is like `Daraz`(an ecommerce site),
and under it, we'll have `email service`, `inventory service`, `storage service` etc under the `my-app`. Create 
`<dependencyManagement><dependencies>` and add common dependencies. The children services will directly inherit common dependencies
from `<dependencyManagement><dependencies>`.

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${spring.boot.dependencies.version}</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>

    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

And in the normal dependency block, add `lombok` to auto-generate the getter and setter. Now we're good to go!

[https://spring.io/microservices](https://spring.io/microservices) is a nice guide to get started. 

An important dependency for spring microservice is `spring-cloud` (just keep in mind, we'll use it later).

## So what are we gonna make?

a demo bank. my-app will be a demo-bank, we'll have some customers, a service will check whether the customer is valid
or not. We'll also have an email service, and notification service.

### Create new module named `Client`

This is our first microservice.
in the `pom.xml(Client)`, add dependency:

```xml

<dependencies>
    <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

After that, the instructor created a new package. (The instructor had only `client/src/main/java`, whereas I have 
`client/src/main/java/com/mycompany/app`, guess I'm gonna delete that folder, and follow the instructor precisely).

Delete com.mycompany.app/Main.java (In case anything goes wrong, recreate it manually. it's simply prints a hello world in psvm).
Now create package `com.soumic.client`. Create `ClientApplication` class. Annotate it with `@SpringBootApplication`, and 
add a `psvm`, and add:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ClientApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ClientApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```
Next we'll be developing our business logics.
Important note: we'll be running this on different servers, and different ports.

Since we'll be using localHost, we'll run services on different ports.

Create an `application.yml` file under `resources` directory. Yml is kinda like python. so indentation is very important.
in your `resources/application.yml` file, add:

```yml
server:
  port: 8080
```

* Onto the business logic. Let's create a model named `Client`, and annotate with @Data, @Builder to autogenerate constructor,
getter, setter etc using lombok.

* Create a ClientController class.
```java
@Slf4j  // for logging
@RestController  // rest
@RequestMapping("api/v1/clients")  // starts with this url pattern
public class ClientController { }
```

We may also use `record` instead of `class` as it has some benifits.
```java
@Slf4j  // for logging
@RestController  // rest
@RequestMapping("api/v1/clients")  // starts with this url pattern
public record ClientController(ClientService clientService) {
  public void registerClient() {}
}
```

Also create a class named `ClientService`.
After that create a record `ClientServiceRequest`.

Now we want to save data, hence comes db. We'll be seeing some docker (docker compose) stuffs soon!

59:30 sec to be continued...

## Docker Basics
* Image: is nothing but source code.
* Container: When we run an image(ie, src code), we call it a container. An instance of the image is a container.
Go to docker website  https://hub.docker.com
* Need to install docker-desktop
* Suppose I installed postgres db via docker. then in my laptop, a container of postgres will be created, and my code
will communicate with that container
* Docker is kinda vm
  <img src="./docs/pics/class-6-pic-2-virtual-machine.png" alt="img3.jpg" width="500"/>
  <img src="./docs/pics/class-6-pic-3-how-docker-works.png" alt="img3.jpg" width="500"/>
* docker desktop is better for beginners. you can even run kubernetes inside the docker desktop.
```bash
$ sudo docker pull hello-world
Using default tag: latest  # use latest, or specific tag
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
Digest: sha256:e18f0a777xxxx-xxxx-xxxx671ab3ec3eed05414477c951ab1a6f352a06974245fe7  # unique identifier
Status: Image is up to date for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest

$ docker run hello-world
```

## Useful commands:
```bash
$ docker ps  # shows running containers...
(base) soumic@Zephyrus-G14:~/Codes/JavaSpringTutorial$ sudo docker ps
[sudo] password for soumic:       
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
(base) soumic@Zephyrus-G14:~/Codes/JavaSpringTutorial$
```

`$ docker ps -a` will show both running, and non-running containers.

Since docker is using my computer resources, I need to always monitor which containers are running, or I need.
Each container has an unique id. Use it to stop a container.

```bash
$ docker container rm <CONTAINER_ID>
# for example,
$ docker container rm 1234efrgrb45
```

The process that controls these commands is called `docker-daemon`.

## Docker compose
is a yml file. We can specify which docker containers I want, how many images I want, etc. Say I need Redis, Apache 
kafka, and postgres, I can specify them in the compose file. We also need to configure some networking.
```

dockerCompose |--> docker file --> postgres container  --->|--------------------| 
              |                                            | a single service   |
              |--> docker file --> pgAdmin container ------->|--------------------|
```

Under `my-app` create a `docker-compose.yml` file.

We can find these commands online :/

Now if we want to use this docker-compose.yml, then:
```bash
$ cd /path/to/my-app
$ls
Client  docker-compose.yml  pom.xml  src
$ docker compose up -d # -d for detached mode, ie, we won't see anything on the terminal... 
service "pgadmin" refers to undefined volume pgadmin: invalid compose project # I got this stupid error -_-
```
To see containers, we need to use 
```bash
$ docker compose ps  # NOT docker ps
```

I can't proceed forward without repairing this error...
1:29:40 to be continued...

Found the error. It was a silly typo at the last line:
```yml
services:
# ... ... ...
volumes:
  postgres:
  # pdadmin:  I wrote `d` instead of a `g`. Years of academic training wasted!
  pgadmin:
```

Set pgAdmin master password: pg_admin_master_password

(idk, there was a popup, I just typed in a password quickly, and saved it in the readme.md file, lol. never ever do it in production).

## Create a new server
* General -> Name: postgres
* Connection 
* -> Host name/address: postgres
* -> Username: soumic  (looks like this must be the same as provided in the yml)
* -> password: my_awesome_password  (looks like this must be the same as provided in the yml)
* -> save password: true

* Now save, and create a new server.
  
(Looks like I screwed up somewhere, so just to be sure on what is going on, I am deleting the docker compose containers.
Basically invoke, `sudo docker rm <CONTAINER_NAME> # here CONTAINER_NAME = postgres, and pgadmin`
```bash
(base) soumic@Zephyrus-G14:~/Codes/JavaSpringTutorial/MicroServiceDemoMvn/my-app$ docker compose ps -a

```

Okay, I recreated, but the db persisted. looks like we need to remove [docker volume](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63949153/9053942).
My first attempt failed, cz I was trying to delete volume without removing the container. so first remove the containers, then remove the volumes[reference stackOverFlow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73876900/9053942)!
```bash
(base) soumic@Zephyrus-G14:~/Codes/JavaSpringTutorial/MicroServiceDemoMvn/my-app$ sudo docker compose ps -a
NAME                COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
pgadmin             "/entrypoint.sh"         pgadmin             exited (0)          
postgres            "docker-entrypoint.s…"   postgres            exited (0)          
(base) soumic@Zephyrus-G14:~/Codes/JavaSpringTutorial/MicroServiceDemoMvn/my-app$ sudo docker rm pgadmin

).

Now we'll create a new database for our client microservice.

right click on Databases -> create -> database.

Give name = `client`. So everything related to client microservice will be inside the client db.

Now our main focus will be the client microservice. Hence close all tabs except client related. Add postgres, and 
hibernate dependencies in `client/pom.xml`.
```xml
<dependencies>
<!-- ... ... ... -->
    <!--        jpa hibernate -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!--        postgres -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
## An important part, configure spring to use postgres
Previously we used hibernate as default. But now we'll be using postgres. So we need to make some changes.
Open Client's application.yml (ie, `my-app/Client/src/main/resources/application.yml`).

Now let's run and see if everything is ok. Hmm, looks ok...

Open client model, and add the following lombok annotations:
```java

@Data // generated getter, setter, constructor
@Builder // eta maybe Builder.withId(1).withFirstName("foo").build(); erokom kore dey, need to verify.
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Entity  // because this is a db model
public class Client {
  @Id  // primary key
  // we won't be autogenerating the pks. instead, we'll create a sequence maintained ids. @SequenceGenerator, and @Generatedvalue  help us to maintain the sequences.
  
  @SequenceGenerator(
      name = Constants.CLIENT_ID_SEQUENCE,
      sequenceName = Constants.CLIENT_ID_SEQUENCE // "client_id_sequence"
  )
  @GeneratedValue(
      strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE,
      generator = Constants.CLIENT_ID_SEQUENCE
  )
  private int id;
  // ... ...
}
```

Next create a repository named `ClientRepository`.
```java

@Repository
public interface ClientRepository extends JpaRepository<Client, Integer> {
}
```

Now open `ClientService`, and pass a clientRepository in the constructor:
```java
@Service
public record ClientService(ClientRepository clientRepository) {
  public void registerClient(ClientRegistrationRequest request) {
    Client client =
        Client.builder()
            .firstName(request.firstName())
            .lastName(request.lastName())
            .email(request.email())
            .build();

    // now we want to save it in a db. so add some db code...
    clientRepository.save(client); // <-- Also, add this line!
  }
}
```

Now we go to the controller class, and modify it:
```java
public record ClientController(ClientService clientService) {
  @PostMapping
  public void registerClient(@RequestBody ClientRegistrationRequest clientRegistrationRequest) {
    log.info("new client registration {}", clientRegistrationRequest);
    clientService.registerClient(clientRegistrationRequest); // api request e input, seta clientService ke dibo
  }
}
```

Now let's run it:
```logcatfilter
   drop sequence if exists client_id_sequence
2022-11-04 19:45:19.658  WARN 34852 --- [           main] o.h.engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper   : SQL Warning Code: 0, SQLState: 00000

```
As we can see, spring hibernate has created a `table client`, and `client_id_sequence` for us.
In huge projects, the `sequence` (ie, `client_id_sequence`) helps us a lot.

<img src="./docs/pics/class-6-pic-5-table-and-sequence-are-autogenerated.png" alt="class-6-pic-1-microservice-architecture.png" width="500"/>

If we right-click on client table, and select view all rows, then it appears on the browser.

Hit a post request using postman, the video got response code 200, I got 415 unsupported media type :/
I've done something wrong! pause video at `1h 46m 45s`.

Oh! the code was ok. In postman, I `text` format was selected by default, not `json`. Hence, I got that error. After changing to `json`, the api worked!

## Onto the next, create a new Module named `Spam`
This microservice will detect whether a client is actually valid or not.

Copy all dependencies from Client's pom.xml to Spam's pom.xml.
Create `SpamApplication.java`.
In the resources, create an `application.yml`, and add:
```yml

server:
  port: 8081  # make sure to change the port
spring:
  application:
    name: spam
```

Now open SpamApplication, and on the file, intellijIdea shows a run button. Hit the run button!
After that, basically copy, and paste everything in the spam module, ie, SpamService, SpamRepository, SpamController, etc.

## Homework
Create a notification service, and make sure you create a table.

Created one, simply inserted some rows, but there's sth wrong with postman's working.
If I use `body -> x-www-form-urlencoded`, the model is inserting properly. but if I create a json file in the `Body -> raw`,
all of my fields are null :confused: . No idea what went wrong in the postman thing... Apart from that, everything looks ok.
